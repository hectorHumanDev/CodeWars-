// Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.
// Example:

// ["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]

// None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
